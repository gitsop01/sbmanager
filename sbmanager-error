TO-DO 

    The initial test of the application failed to run due to Gmutex locks and unlocks
    although some of the library used are thread safe or their functions are thread safe
    this file is a reminder to review the source code when development reaches a stable
    code base.


    The Glib threading system is automatically initialised at the start of the program
    Ref: - Glib Reference manual - Glib is thread safe

    GMutex Locks
    Clutter threading support is initialized when Clutter is initialized
