This is a change log for sbmanager to GTK3 for Gnome3 and clutter 1.12-2 

Change All Clutter deprecated functions to bring it up to clutter 1.12-2.
There was a lot of deprecated functions as the Clutter API has changed a lot.

Change code for all compiler warnings for both GTK3 and minor libimobiledevice 
library calls and function arguments.

At this point the code compiled using gcc but the application failed to run due
to gtk2 and gtk3 library available.  

For development test remove GTK2 library from development system
to ensure the application still runs. The application should operate
with both gtk2 and gtk3 libraries available but at the moment I have removed it
from the development system to concentrate on changes above and debugging of code
in general.

Recompile using only gtk3 library installed.

The application failed to run due to Gmutex locks and these where removed in the code
but a review will be done when the code base is stable to ensure that in the areas
that the Gmutex where removed that this does not cause stability issues. At this time
debugger sessions indicated that the application is stable with the Gmutex locks removed.

Thread code functions was altered to include a name for debugging and due to deprecated functions.

A callback function was fixed that allowed the icons to load to the stage

Deprecated timing functions and Clutter callback functions altered were necessary.

At this point the application ran but did not load any initial Gui image data files.

Further clutter code was added to load icons, and needs further cleanup and proper error code
handling .

Clutter code was added to the gui.c file for initial gui image files load but failed due to not
setting the size of the images in clutter,further cleanup and error code handling still to be 
done.

Lots of debugging code added around Clutter functions to isolate Clutter critical run time errors
or for debugging code in general.

Gui-init - added error handling for new image file loading code.

Fixed background color for folders, gui fade in/out and spinner routines and battery display which
had not been altered in the original Clutter code update.

Code review for all clutter code to ensure correct functions are being used and arguments are correct
after finding several clutter actor functions and/or arguments that were not correct.
